This app showcases an SLX simulation and Proof3D animation being driven by Tropofy. A simple queueing system of six product combinations and three processes is simulated using SLX. The products are represented as cars which can be coloured red, green, or blue and come in small or big sizes. Three different processors in the system colour, shape and size the cars. The simulation writes a trace file which Proof3D interprets to produce a .avi formatted animation of the simulation. Note that the animation can take a few minutes to process.
